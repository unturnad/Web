		<p>When there is no more hope. When intern is coming. When the vibe coders prepare to break down the Wall and JAVA can no longer stop them ... <br><br>
			Comes he - Javascript. Lord of untyped data and components, the language when you need to have ways to predict every possible data coming... he does not give up technical tasks "to do nicely" and is not afraid of calculations on the user side. But he comes not alone, having 3 of his faithful friends with him: jQuery, React.js and Node.js.</p>
		<p>When there is no more hope, when Winter is coming, and the White Walkers prepare to break down the Wall, JAVA can no longer stop them. But fear not, for in the darkest hour, comes he - Javascript. Lord of untyped data and components, he does not give up technical tasks "to do nicely" and is not afraid of calculations on the user side. But he comes not alone; with him are three of his faithful friends: jQuery, React.js, and Node.js. <br><br>

			Together, they stand as a formidable force, ready to face the challenges ahead. jQuery, the stalwart companion, simplifying DOM manipulation and event handling. React.js, the virtuoso of UI components, bringing order to the chaos of front-end development. And Node.js, the powerhouse of server-side JavaScript, enabling scalable and efficient backend solutions. <br><br>
			
			In the face of adversity, they unite, leveraging their strengths to defend against the encroaching darkness. For in the world of technology, when one language falters, another rises to meet the challenge, and in the realm of JavaScript, hope endures, even in the coldest of winters.</p>
